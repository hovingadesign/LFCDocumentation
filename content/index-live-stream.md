## Live Stream Workflow – Task Guides

### Overview

This index organizes the end-to-end live stream into seven focused tasks. Each task references the corresponding screenshots in `SourceScrennshots/` using timestamps to match your capture sequence.

### Tasks

- [Restore ATEM Camera Grades](live-stream/01-restore-atem-camera-grades.md)
- [Build ProPresenter AM/PM Playlists](live-stream/02-build-propresenter-playlists.md)
- [Update SermonAudio Webcast Details](live-stream/03-update-sermonaudio-webcast.md)
- [Verify Live on HELO and Platforms](live-stream/04-verify-live-helo-platforms.md)
- [Publish and Copy SermonAudio ID](live-stream/05-publish-sermonaudio-copy-id.md)
- [Embed Sermon on lfcopc.org](live-stream/06-embed-on-lfcopc-website.md)
- [Add New Song to ProPresenter](live-stream/07-add-new-song-propresenter.md)

### Notes

- Replace any generic captions with exact UI labels after a quick pass against the app UIs.
- Developer docs references are listed in each guide for optional verification.
