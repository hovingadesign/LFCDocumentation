## Build ProPresenter AM/PM Playlists

## Overview

Prepare the AM and PM service playlists by searching for and adding slides/songs so operators can run the service smoothly.

## Prerequisites

- ProPresenter installed and library available

## Steps

1) Open ProPresenter and navigate to playlists
   - Launch ProPresenter; open the Playlists pane.
   - Select today’s AM and PM playlists (create new if needed).

   ![ProPresenter playlists]({{ '/images/live-stream/02-propresenter-playlists.png' | relative_url }})

2) Search and add items to the playlist(s)
   - Use the search bar to find songs/slides in the library.
   - Drag items into AM/PM playlists; reorder via drag-and-drop.
   - Rename playlist headings if needed (e.g., date + service time).

   ![Add items to playlists]({{ '/images/live-stream/02-propresenter-add-items.png' | relative_url }})

## Troubleshooting / Tips

- If items are missing, check the library path and import status
- Keep naming consistent for quick search and reuse
