## Verify Live on HELO and Platforms

## Overview

Confirm that the stream is active on the encoder (HELO) and visible on SermonAudio and its YouTube recast. This validates end-to-end signal before service.

## Prerequisites

- HELO device and network access
- SermonAudio and YouTube configured as destinations

## Steps

1) Start the stream via the AJA HELO
   - Use the "HELO RECORD" and "HELO STREAM" buttons on the Stream Deck to start the recording and live stream.
   - Use the HELO web interface (http://192.168.0.52/) to verify stream is connected and running.
   - Verify the "Alarms" is green and says "None"

2) Verify SermonAudio destination shows ingest/preview
   - In the "Webcasts" tab of Sermon Audio, ensure the stream is connected and that the YouTube Simulcast automatically started as it should.
   - Confirm a healthy preview/ingest indicator and that metadata matches the webcast details.

3) Confirm YouTube recast is receiving and healthy
   - Login to YouTube (https://studio.youtube.com/) and navigate to the "Live" Tab
   - Once the stream is started it should automatically appear here with the title entered into Sermon Audio.

4) Confirm YouTube Settings
   - Open the Live stream, YouTube will promt if this is "For Kids", you can choose No.
   - You can then keep this window open to monitor the YouTube stream, but this is not neccesary
