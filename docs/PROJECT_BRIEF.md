# Project Brief

Status: draft
Date: 2025-10-13
Owner: Documentation Team

## Purpose

Establish a clear, maintainable documentation workspace with templates, tracking docs, and a consistent structure.

## Audience

- Internal team members creating and maintaining documentation
- New contributors with minimal prior knowledge

## Scope

- In-scope: Folder structure, templates, style guide, tracking docs
- Out-of-scope: Installing dependencies, external integrations, publishing automation

## Requirements Anchors

- DOC-1: Establish documentation folder structure (`content/`, `images/`, `docs/`, `_archive/`).
- DOC-2: Provide a reusable How-To template in `content/templates/`.
- DOC-3: Provide project docs: `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS.md`, `RISKS.md`, `TODO.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
- DOC-4: Do not install any dependencies or create external connections at this time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Folder structure exists and is documented in `README.md` (DOC-1)
- How-To template available and referenced (DOC-2)
- Tracking and style documents created and initialized (DOC-3)
- No package manifests or external connections added (DOC-4)

## Non-Goals

- Selecting a static site generator
- CI/CD publishing setup
- Content migration beyond placeholders

## Links

- Style Guide: `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- TODOs: `docs/TODO.md`
- Decisions: `docs/DECISIONS.md`
