# Risks

- The `SourceScrennshots/` folder name appears to have a typo; standardizing later may break links. Mitigation: keep as-is for now and plan a migration task.
- Without a static site framework, front-matter may not be consumed automatically. Mitigation: keep simple Markdown and add SSG later if needed.
- Style drift over time. Mitigation: maintain `STYLE_GUIDE.md` and `DECISIONS.md`.
