# Images – Curation Guide

This repository keeps raw, sequential captures in `SourceScrennshots/`. When ready, copy only the final images used by guides into `images/live-stream/` and update references in the docs.

Recommended flow:

- Keep `SourceScrennshots/` as your working set and source of truth for chronology.
- For each guide, select 1–3 most helpful images and copy to `images/live-stream/` using descriptive names (e.g., `sermonaudio-publish-step-02.png`).
- Update the guide image references to point to `images/live-stream/`.
- Record any renames or moves in `docs/DECISIONS.md` if they affect many links.

Until curation is done, guides intentionally reference the raw images in `SourceScrennshots/`.
